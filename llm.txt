I have used ChatGPT for this assignment. I've used it, because i find it faster when finding general answers regarding formatting, language syntax and method usage. Most of the time I only use the code snippet of the answer and I do not copy paste it in its raw form. The LLM helped, because the answers are better fitted to my specific question than general answer posted on a forum like StackOverflow. 

Exemplary prompts include:
- java deserialize list of dtos using objectmapper
- c# split string on whitespace, remove empty entries, split into 4
- java log4j logger get instance
- generate css code to prettify this html page

In general, I have the experience of LLMs hallucinating and making mistakes the more special the knowledge you need is. Examples of this include making up libraries, method names. 

The LLM does not provide good feedback when debugging a specific error and providing dependency information (library or image versions and their combability, defining maven dependencies and plugins). I do not use LLMs for this use cases as I find it faster to google the answers as most of the time someone else has experienced it before.
